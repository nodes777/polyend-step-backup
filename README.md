# Polyend Step Backup

This repository manages the contents of my **Polyend Step** SD card.  
It keeps a version-controlled history of changes while I work on songs and setlists.

## 📀 Updating the Setlist

1. Insert the Polyend Step **SD card** into your computer.  
2. Reconcile any changes made on the SD card with what’s already in this repo.  
   - (TODO: add detailed reconciliation instructions here)  
3. Make any setlist changes you need.  
   - **Song naming convention** (must be followed):  
     ```
     STEP/Songs/1 - E Beat
     ```
4. Stage and commit your changes:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update setlist"
   git push
   ```
5. Overwrite the SD card with the contents of this repo.
